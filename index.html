                    <h2>How do we do this?</h2>
                    <p>Every 3 months (1 quarter of the year) we pick a new health topic to focus on. We publish articles educating about these health conditions and include other organizations that are focused on fundraising for or treating these health issues. Every quarter we share a personal story from someone who has lived with this health issue along with lots of educational content so you can learn and understand our focus well. For every health focus we have, we also have a country that is affected by it and is our chosen country to aid. We plan fundraisers and events to help people in our chosen country get treated or to raise funds for research and development.</p>
